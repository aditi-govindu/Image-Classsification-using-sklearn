# Image Classsification using sklearn
Using Machine learning algorithms to classify images under 3 categories

# sklearn
sklearn or scikit learn is a library in Python with efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modelling.
This project uses the **SVM** or Support Vector machine module under sklearn library to classify images under 1 of 3 categories

# Support Vector Machine (SVM)
SVMs are supervised machine learning algorithms that are used for 2 group classifications (They can be used for more than 2 classes, by changing the kernel parameters)
In this code, we have 3 classes to classify:
'''
Pizza
Burger
Momos
